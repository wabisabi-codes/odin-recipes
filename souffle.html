      These fluffy and extra-thick Japanese pancakes are mouthwatering! They are
      soft and spongy, and a true indulgence. The super secret ingredient is the
      mayonnaise.

    <p class="history">
      Despite their name, Japanese soufflé pancakes are from Hawaii. As the
      story goes, the pancakes were created by a chef at Cream Pot, a restaurant
      in Waikīkī. Chef Nathan Tran was not a fan of pancakes, but he did enjoy
      soufflés. To appease Japanese tourists clamoring for American-style
      pancakes, he came up with these soufflé pancakes, which were then taken to
      Japan, where they trended hard. They made their way around Asia and back
      to the U.S. by way of chain restaurants and independent cafés.

        <li>
          Combine milk and vinegar in a large bowl. Allow to sit until milk has
          soured, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, sift together flour, sugar, and baking powder in a separate
          bowl; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl with an electric
          mixer until stiff peaks form.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add egg yolks and vanilla extract to the soured milk; mix until well
          combined and pour into the center of the flour mixture. Use a whisk to
          combine all ingredients. Add mayonnaise and stir until there are no
          lumps. Fold in egg whites.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat a griddle on the stovetop over medium-low heat and melt butter.
          Grease round pancake molds and place onto the buttered griddle. Fill
          each mold halfway with batter. Cook until pancakes are golden brown on
          the bottom and not too liquid across the top, 4 to 6 minutes. Flip
          each pancake and mold together. Cook until the other sides are golden
          and pancakes have doubled in thickness, 4 to 6 more minutes. Slide the
          molds off the pancakes.
