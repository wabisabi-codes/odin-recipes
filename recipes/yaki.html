    <h4>
      Yaki Udon is a classic Japanese stir-fry dish with udon noodles and lots
      of vegetables in a soy-based sauce. Feel free to add meat or tofu.
    </h4>
    <p>
      The widely accepted story of yaki udon's origins is that in post-World War
      II Japan a noodle shop couldn't get their regular yakisoba noodles due to
      food shortages. Instead they substituted them with chewy udon noodles and
      soon a new specialty dish was born.

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk together oyster sauce, soy sauce, mirin, rice vinegar,
        Worcestershire, sesame oil, sugar, Sriracha, and garlic in a small bowl;
        set aside. Remove root ends from scallions and discard. Chop whites and
        light greens into 2-inch pieces and quarter pieces lengthwise; set
        aside. Thinly slice remaining dark greens of scallions and reserve for
        garnish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms
        in a single layer and cook, undisturbed, until browned on first side,
        about 3 minutes. Stir and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until
        mushrooms are tender and golden brown on both sides, about 4 more
        minutes. Add bok choy, carrots, sliced whites and light greens of
        scallions, and 1/4 cup water to pan with mushrooms. Cook, stirring
        occasionally, until vegetables are just tender, about 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add udon noodles and remaining 1/4 cup water and cook, gently separating
        noodles with tongs or spoon. Add reserved oyster sauce mixture and cook,
        stirring constantly, until noodles and vegetables are well-coated, about
        1 minute. Divide among serving bowls and garnish with reserved sliced
        greens of scallions and optional garnishes. Serve immediately.
