      The omelet is sweet, has a light texture, and works well when served over
      sushi rice and with soy and wasabi sauce for dipping. Mirin is sweet rice
      wine and dashi is traditional Japanese soup stock made from kelp or
      shiitake.

    <p>
      After World War II, the government encouraged the production of eggs to
      feed children with protein. As a result, eggs became available cheaply
      after sugar and mirin. In the 1950s, modern Tamagoyaki ware that could
      easily be made using “eggs, soy sauce, sugar, mirin” became popular.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Dashi stock</li>
      <li>White sugar</li>
      <li>Mirin</li>
      <li>Soy sauce</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Beat eggs thoroughly in a bowl; whisk in dashi stock, sugar, mirin, and
        soy sauce until sugar has dissolved.
      </li>
      <li>Lightly grease a nonstick skillet and heat over medium heat.</li>
      <li>
        Pour a thin layer of egg mixture into the hot pan and swirl to coat the
        pan. Cook until egg layer is firm on the bottom but still slightly
        liquid on top, about 1 minute. Then lift up one edge using a spatula and
        roll up the egg layer. Push omelet roll to one side of the skillet. Oil
        the skillet again and pour in another thin layer of egg, lifting the
        first omelet roll up slightly to allow the egg to flow underneath; roll
        up the first omelet in the new layer of egg and push omelet to the edge
        of the skillet as before. Repeat the process with the remaining egg
        mixture, oiling the pan each time if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add egg yolks and vanilla extract to the soured milk; mix until well
        combined and pour into the center of the flour mixture. Use a whisk to
        combine all ingredients. Add mayonnaise and stir until there are no
        lumps. Fold in egg whites.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove rolled omelet to a serving platter and cut into 6 equal pieces to
        serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
